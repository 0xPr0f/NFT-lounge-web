The metaverse (https://github.com/0xPr0f/NFTLounge).

## This is my submission for the NFT hack 2022 by ethglobal

path to the code of the metaverse.
https://github.com/0xPr0f/NFTLounge/tree/main/Assets/script

The web app was built with react  
The metaverse was built with unity 3D

project  https://showcase.ethglobal.com/nfthack2022/nft-lounge

## How it's made
This project was built with the following --->
- polygon
- livepeer
- ipfs/filecoin
- nft.storage
- NFT port
- covalent
- Unity 3D
- etc
--- polygon : the contract was deployed on polygon and that is where the metaverse fetches the nft from the smartcontract on polygon and displays it in a 3D environment to visualise your NFT.

-- livepeer : the web app can create a stream and then generate some key to plug to your streamsoftware like obs to start a stream then you can take the lounge key to your metaverse to play it in the metaverse, the loader used for the streams has advanced buffer mechanism and if the stream is short (5 - 7mins) it can be minted.

-- ipfs/filecoin : ipfs is use to store the nfts  created online and to have then on the smart contract so they can be fetched and displayed in the marketplace and in the metavere.we also use ipfs in nftport and nft.storage to store the streams and mint them

-- nft.storage :  i used this to store the ipfs stream in a blob which is connect to an api key to have them persist permanently 

-- NFT port : this is used to do the gasless minting for the stream, so the user will not have to pay gas to keep the stream on the blockchain and in the smart contract (NFTport.xyz contract)

-- covalent : this is used to read the data of the lazy minted ad show the user the data derived from the minting 

-- Unity 3D : this is the engine where the metaverse is run on that gives out high quality graphic and a versatile program language that can be used for various purposes
